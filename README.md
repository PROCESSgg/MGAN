# MGAN

Data for our AAAI'19 paper "[Exploiting Coarse-to-Fine Task Transfer for Aspect-level Sentiment Classification](https://hsqmlzno1.github.io/assets/publications/MGAN2019.pdf)".


A new, large-scale (100k for each domain), multi-domain, aspect-category (AC) level corpus, which acts as highly beneficial source domains to improve the learning in the task of aspect-term level (AT) sentiment analysis.

Even with a simple attention-based model for the AT task, our methods can achieve the STOA performances by leveraging the knowledge distilled from the AC task.
